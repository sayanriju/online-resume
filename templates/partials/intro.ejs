        <p class="alt-colors">I'm an Experienced & Passionate Coder who prefers to work on the backend, in particular using <span>Express Framework (Node JS)</span> & <span>Mongo DB</span>, but I'm conversant with frontend tech like <span>Vue JS</span> as well. I also have ample experience in managing medium size teams.</p>
        <p>I am versed with Version Control Systems like <span class="green">Git</span>.</p>
        <p>In general, I try to keep abreast of the latest trends in relevant technologies.</p>
        <p>I've been working almost exclusively on <span class="green">Linux systems</span> for the last decade or so.
        </p>
        <p>I'm idealistic about <span class="orange">Free &amp; Open-source Software</span>, contributing often to such
          projects as coder, documenter and advocate.
